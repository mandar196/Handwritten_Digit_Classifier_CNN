# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition-Using-Keras-Tkinter-for-GUI-

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes.

Required libraries: pip install numpy, tensorflow, keras.

The Tkinter library comes in the Python standard library.I have created a function predict_digit() that takes the image as input and then uses the trained model to predict the digit.

Then i created the App class which is responsible for building the GUI for our app,then created a canvas where we can draw by capturing the mouse event and with a button, we trigger the predict_digit() function and display the results.
